# Python Arithmetic Operators
# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values.
# The basic arithmetic operators are:
# Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), Modulus (%), Exponentiation (**), Floor Division (//).
# # Examples of Arithmetic Operators
# a = 10
# b = 3
#
# Addition
# addition = a + b
# print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {addition}")
#
# Subtraction
# subtraction = a - b
# print(f"Subtraction: {a} - {b} = {subtraction}")
#
# Multiplication
# multiplication = a * b
# print(f"Multiplication: {a} * {b} = {multiplication}")
#
# Division
# division = a / b
# print(f"Division: {a} / {b} = {division}")
#
# Modulus
# modulus = a % b
# print(f"Modulus: {a} % {b} = {modulus}")
#
# Exponentiation
# exponentiation = a ** b
# a = 3
# b = 5
# exponentiation = a ** b
# result = 3 ** 5
# 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3
